            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                Through this project, our goal was to render the Tyndall Effect by shooting a ray through a volumetrically
                rendered medium. We approached the problem by first rendering both homogenous and heterogenous fog. We implemented
                ray marching where we had to account for the probabilities of absorption, scattering, and transmittance for each
                step. As for heterogenous fog, we implemented a Perlin Noise to vary the densities when traveling through the
                medium.

            <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
            <h3>Homogenous Fog </h3>
            <h4>Initial idea</h4>
            <p>

                We built upon the ray tracer code from Project 3 as the underlying framework for our project. Initially, our
                approach to implementing homogenous fog, as suggested by Goodman, involved calculating a distance by selecting a
                uniform random number, ε, within the range [0, 1]. This value was then used to determine the time, t, which we
                interpreted as indicating either a surface or medium intersection. However, we encountered difficulties
                integrating this method with our existing ray tracing code. As a result, we opted for a different strategy based
                on ray marching.
            </p>

            <h4>Ray Marching</h4>
            <p>
                As we know that rays that pass through a medium lose energy due to absorption and out-scattering and gain energy
                due to in-scattering. We represent the scattering interaction through &sigma;<sub>s</sub> and the absorption
                interaction through . Beer-Lambert's Law \[T_{r} = {e^{-\sigma_{t}d}}.\] gives us the
                attenuation of the light
                traveling through some distance d where &sigma;<sub>t</sub> = &sigma;<sub>s</sub> + &sigma;<sub>a</sub>. As we are
                only dealing with homogenous mediums for now, the density term is constant. Just like how we use BSDFs for surface
                interactions, for media interactions we use a Phase Function since the outgoing direction can now be scattered in
                all directions vs just the hemisphere of directions in surface interactions. For isotropic volumes the phase
                function is simple being 1/4&pi; as it is equally scattered in all directions. However, for anisotropic volumes we
                use the Henyey-Greenstein Phase function
                \[p(\theta) = {{1 \over 4\pi}{{1 - g^2} \over [1 + g^2 - 2g*cos(\theta)]^{3/2}}}.\]
                that is parameterized by an asymmetry factor g controlling back and
                front scattering.
            </p>
            <p>
                We can finally put together ray marching as follows: <br><br>

                For a certain number of steps, we march the ray's position forward for a chosen step size and for each step we:
            <ol>
                <li>Calculate the fraction of light that is not absorbed or out-scattered traveling a segment of the
                    medium and update the transmission.</li>
                <li>We sample the light to find the distance to the light and the direction to the light and calculate the
                    probability we scatter in a certain direction.</li>
                <li>Calculate the in-scattering contribution by sampling the light and calculate the attenuation the light ray
                    travels to the point and update the running total of in-scattering light.</li>
            </ol>
            </p>

            <h3>Heterogenous Fog</h3>
            <p>
                For Heterogenous fog, the density varies throughout the medium instead of staying constant. To create this density
                field, we implemented a Perlin Noise function that generates smooth, continuous noise that is useful for
                simulating natural phenomena such as Fog.
            </p>

            <h4>Perlin Noise Function</h4>
            <p>
                We implemented our Perlin Noise function by initially generating random normalized vectors that correspond to the
                corners of the 3D cube encompassing each sample point. To increase efficiency and reduce the number of directions
                generated, we used what's called a permutation table which randomly selects gradients to be at each corner of the
                cube. This table is accessed via a hash function hashing the (x, y, z) coordinates of the cube's corners. We
                interpolate between the dot products of the distance vectors—extending from the cube edges to our sample
                point—and the gradient vectors associated with each corner. This interpolation calculates the final noise
                value at the sample point, effectively producing the Perlin Noise.
            </p>

            <h4>Updated Ray Marching</h4>
            <p>
                A Heterogenous medium changes our ray marching algorithm since the densities along our light ray vary as it
                travels through the medium thus our estimation for the in-scattering term is different so we must ray march
                our light ray. While we march our light ray we accumulate density values along each sample along the ray. We
                replace our constant density with our Perlin Noise function and sample at each point for both rays.
