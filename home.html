            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                Through this project, our goal was to render the Tyndall Effect by shooting a ray through a volumetrically
                rendered medium. We approached the problem by first rendering both homogenous and heterogenous fog. We implemented
                raymarching where we had to account for the probabilities of absorption, scattering, and transmittance for each
                step. As for heterogenous fog, we implemented a Perlin Noise to vary the densities when traveling through the
                medium.

            <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
            <h3>Homogenous Fog </h3>
            <!-- We inherited our Project 3s ray tracer code to be the base of our project. Our very initial implementation for
            homogenous fog described by Goodman included computing a distance based off selecting a uniform number ε &isin;
            [0, 1] and calculating the time t interpreting it as either a surface or medium intersection. However, we weren't
            able to get our current ray tracing methods to work with this implementation so we opted for another strategy that was
            based off raymarching. -->

            <h4>Initial implementation</h4>
            <p>

                We built upon the ray tracer code from Project 3 as the underlying framework for our project. Initially, our
                approach to implementing homogenous fog, as suggested by Goodman, involved calculating a distance by selecting a
                uniform random number, ε, within the range [0, 1]. This value was then used to determine the time, t, which we
                interpreted as indicating either a surface or medium intersection. However, we encountered difficulties
                integrating this method with our existing ray tracing code. As a result, we opted for a different strategy based
                on ray marching.

            <h4>Ray Marching</h4>
            <p>
                As we know that rays that pass through a medium lose energy due to absorption and out-scattering and gain energy
                due to in-scattering. We represent the scattering interaction through &sigma;<sub>s</sub> and the absorption
                interaction through &sigma;<sub>a</sub>. Beer-Lambert's Law (shown below) gives us the attenuation of the light
                traveling through some distance d where &sigma;<sub>t</sub> = &sigma;<sub>s</sub> + &sigma;<sub>a</sub>. As we are
                only dealing with homogenous mediums for now, the density term is constant. Just like how we use BSDFs for surface
                interactions, for media interactions we use a Phase Function since the outgoing direction can now be scattered in
                all directions vs just the hemisphere of directions in surface interactions. For isotropic volumes the phase
                function is simple as We decided to use the
                Henyey-Greenstein Phase function that is parameterized by



                The summed up idea behind raymarching is as follows:


                For a certain number of steps, we march the ray and for each step we
                1. Calculate the fraction of light that is not absorbed or out-scattered traveling through the segment of the
                medium being our set step size
                2. Update the transmission
                3. Calculate the in-scattering contribution by sampling the light and calculate the attentuation the light ray
                travels to the point and update the running total.
